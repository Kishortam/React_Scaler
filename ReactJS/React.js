// React : Javascript library for building fast & interactive UI and SPA's/
// Developed by Facebook in 2011
// React is an view layer of an MVC Application.
// Declarative view : react will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.
// component based : build encapsulated components that manages their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.


// virtual dom is more efficient than rea dom, when state changes it makes changes in real dom else it makes changes in virtual dom.
// real dom takes more memory.

// node => npm (node package manager) => react library 

// JSX = Javascript syntax extension => use to write code JS and HTML
